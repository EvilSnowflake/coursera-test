                        Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.)
